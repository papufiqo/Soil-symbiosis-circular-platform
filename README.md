Every material entry that claims "soil amendment" or compost use must include lab certificate or verified provenance.

Built-in quality gates: samples with low soil score trigger hold/review workflows and notifications to relevant stakeholders.

Immutable audit trail (append-only event store + optional blockchain anchoring) for provenance and public trust.
